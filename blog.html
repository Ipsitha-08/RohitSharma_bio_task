    Rohit Sharma joined the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 when he was signed by the Deccan Chargers franchise, based in Hyderabad, 
    for the sum of US$750,000 a year. In the 2011 auction, he was sold for US$2 million to the Mumbai Indians. He scored his maiden IPL century 
    in the 2012 season with 109* off 60 balls against the Kolkata Knight Riders. In the 2015 season, he missed his century falling short by just two runs, 
    scoring 98* off 65 balls in the first match of the season against Kolkata Knight Riders but it went in a losing cause.
    Again in the 2018 season, he missed his century, scoring 94 off 52 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore coming in a 46-run win.
    Then he scored his second IPL century in 2024 tournament with 105* off 63 balls against the arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings but this came in a losing cause, 
    this was his 1st century after 12 long years.

    Under his leadership, Mumbai has won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020; they also won the former Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013.
